# ðŸ¦  Covid_Image_Detection_App
This is a deep-learning based web application built using Django, React, and PyTorch. The application works by uploading an image of an x-ray of the chest area and uses a basic convolutional neural network to classify whether there is a presence of COVID or not. The data used for this project is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset
